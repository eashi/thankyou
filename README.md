# thankyou

"thankyou" is Twitch chat bot that listens to a channel, and captures commands from the streamer to credit guests on the channel who contribute with their suggestions. Eventually it will create a commit/PR to the project's code repository.

This project itself is built live on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/emadashi), we stream every Thursday at 20:00 Melbourne Australia time. Make sure to join us! :)
