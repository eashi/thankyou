# thankyou

"thankyou" is Twitch chat bot that listens to a channel, and captures commands from the streamer to credit guests on the channel who contribute with their suggestions. Eventually it will create a commit/PR to the project's code repository.

This project itself is built live on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/emadashi), we stream every Thursday at 20:00 Melbourne Australia time. Make sure to join us! :)

## Contributing

### Prerequisites

You will need the .NET Core 3.1 SDK or later. https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core

### Build and test

After cloning the source code, run `dotnet test` in the repository directory to compile the program and run the test suite.
