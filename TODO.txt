- Refactor in general, create smaller functions...etc.
- Create a `!todo` command to show all the todo items in the TODO.txt file, And/Or show all the //TODO comments in the repo
- Consider not removing and re-cloning the repo everytime. Just fetch if it already exists.
- Melbshaker asks: "What happens if the contributor has already existed in the ReadMe file ?".
    - for now, we don't do anything: the contributor is already there.
    - in the future, maybe we can enhance it so the credit includes the suggestion/help they provided.
- Give the moderator an example if the error whisper to make it easy for them.
- Part of refactoring, pull dependencies out from `WriteContributorsToRepo` so that it can be injected and make the method testable.
- If considering to run this in a container, remove the `Console.Read()` method from `Main`
- Feature request: If someone has been thanked, give them the ability to nominate their Twitter name or GitHub profile to go in the contributors pull request with a chat command, e.g. "!findme @emadashi" or "!findme github.com/eashi"
