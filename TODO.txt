- Add GitHub Action to run unit tests for PRs
- Think of just comparing the user name (between the []) rather than comparing the whole line to detect duplicates.
- Feature request: If someone has been thanked, give them the ability to nominate their Twitter name or GitHub profile to go in the contributorsgit 
- Refactor in general, create smaller functions...etc.
- Create a `!todo` command to show all the todo items in the TODO.txt file, And/Or show all the //TODO comments in the repo
- Melbshaker: in the future, maybe we can enhance it so the credit includes the suggestion/help they provided.
- Give the moderator an example if the error whisper to make it easy for them.
- Consider from jonp333: Could the chat bot temporarily edit the name in it's .gitconfig to the name of the person to thank and then make a commit to the repo. The git log would then show their name.
